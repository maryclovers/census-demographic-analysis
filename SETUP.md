# Setup

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy jupyter

Then run:

jupyter notebook Census_demographic_analysis.ipynb

Run all cells in order. The notebook expects the census CSV in the same directory. If you don't have it, the data loading cell will fail but all the analysis code is still readable.
